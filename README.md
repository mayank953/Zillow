Zestimate:
“Zestimates” are estimated home values based on 7.5 million statistical and machine learning models
that analyze hundreds of data points on each property. And, by continually improving the median
margin of error (from 14% at the onset to 5% today),



# Problem Statement


Our task in this competition is to predict the the difference between the actual price and the estimate
of the price (Zestimate). So, in fact we are predicting, where Zillow’s Zestimate will be good, and
where it will be bad.
However, we don’t have to predict a single value, but instead for 6 different time points (from October
2016 to December 2017)
